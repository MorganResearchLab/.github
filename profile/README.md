# Morgan Lab @ Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen ðŸ‘‹

This is the home of the Morgan Lab. Here you can find our code repositories for various ongoing projects. These are organised into individual repositories, each of 
which is the responsibility of the creators and principle contributors.

The Morgan lab studies the ageing immune system using a combination of statstical genetics, computational biology and high-throughput single cell measurements. Below 
is a short bio of each lab member.

## Mike Morgan (The Boss)
Mike trained as a wet lab biologist in rheumatology research and genetics before jumping ship to become a computational biologist during his postdoctoral years in Oxford 
and Cambridge Universities. He contributed to, and developed his own computational methods and applied these to a range of immunological systems, including the ageing thymus, 
COVID19 and T cell development. 

Mike spends his free time running and hiking the Scottish hills or trying to train his recalcitrant Springador Luna not to go chasing rabbits. Mike is not winning at the 
moment. He has a strong penchant for Yorkshire Tea (the best there is) and porridge. Mike is well suited to life in Scotland.

Haries recently joined Morgan Lab for his PhD. Haries is originally from Jakarta, Indonesia, but at this point we can call him a nomad. Prior to joining, Haries earned his BSc from Gebze Technical University in Turkey followed by working as a data scientist for a Czech-based Finance Company.

Haries loves watching nature documentaries, quiz shows and animated series. Haries also likes learning new languages (He still keeps his years of Duolingo streaks alive) and hacking random stuff.
